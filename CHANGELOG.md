# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order by release.

## 0.1.0 - TBD

First (stable) release.

This component replaces the `Identity` (aka `identity()`) plugin from
zend-mvc, for use with upcoming v3 of that component. Once that stable release
is made, we will issue a 1.0.0 release removing the `dev-develop as 3.0.0`
zend-mvc constraint.
